# Client of the Jessenger app for Windows, Linux (Tested at Manjaro) and probably MacOS
## Jessenger is...
a little lightweight messenger that can be used as a basis for similar projects. Initially developed as an educational project
## Performance
Jessenger is fast application that doesn't uses extra headers, parameters and bla-bla-bla. We don't collect any information about you, we don't transmit tons of data that are should be sended for features that you won't even notice. We understand that a lot of people just check their messages and close the application so they miss a lot of traffic.
## Functionality
Functionality of this application is pure. This messenger had been developed by a student as a learning project so it hasn't all the features found in larger apps. I plan to add following things:

  - Caching

  - Files

  - Displaying videos, GIFs, images etc

  - Profile customization

  - Improve UX/UI design (working on it)

  - Increase security by encrypting the cache with the user's secret key

## Technologies
  - C++

  - Qt: Core, Widgets, Network, Websocket

  - QMake

## Contacts
I would be happy to collaborate so if you're interested, you can check my GitHub-account.
